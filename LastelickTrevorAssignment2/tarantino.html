<h2> Early life</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Born in Knoxville, Tennessee, Tarantino grew up in Los Angeles. Quentin Jerome Tarantino (/ˌtærənˈtiːnoʊ/; born March 27, 1963) is an American film director, screenwriter, producer, author, film critic, and actor. His films are characterized by nonlinear storylines, dark humor, stylized violence, foot fetishism, extended dialogue, ensemble casts, references to popular culture, alternate history, and neo-noir.</p>

<h2>Career</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He began his career as an independent filmmaker with the release of Reservoir Dogs in 1992, a crime thriller film which was in part funded by money from the sale of his screenplay True Romance (1993). Empire magazine hailed Reservoir Dogs as the &ldquo;Greatest Independent Film of All Time&rdquo;. His second film, Pulp Fiction (1994), a crime comedy, was a major success among critics and audiences and won him numerous awards, including the Palme d'Or and the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. He wrote the screenplay for the horror comedy film From Dusk till Dawn (1996), in which he also starred. Tarantino paid homage to the blaxploitation films of the 1970s with Jackie Brown (1997), an adaptation of Elmore Leonard's novel Rum Punch.</p>

<h2>Accomplishments</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tarantino's films have garnered critical and commercial success, and a cult following. He has received many industry awards, including two Academy Awards, two BAFTA Awards, four Golden Globe Awards, and the Palme d'Or, and has been nominated for an Emmy and five Grammys. In 2005, he was included on the annual Time 100 list of the most influential people in the world. Filmmaker and historian Peter Bogdanovich has called him &ldquo;the single most influential director of his generation&rdquo;. In December 2015, Tarantino received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to the film industry.</p>
